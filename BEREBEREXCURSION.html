  The medinas of Morocco's old imperial cities will transport you back in time
  as you navigate their winding narrow alleys filled with tiny shops bursting
  with handmade Moroccan wares – brilliant colored babouche slippers, delicate
  filigree silver jewelry, beautifully patterned ceramics, ornate lanterns
  casting a kaleidoscope of colors. You can easily lose yourself for hours
  taking in their charm.&nbsp; Make sure to sip refreshing mint tea as you take
  respite from the afternoon heat.
</p>
<p>
  Venture into the Atlas Mountains to the thousand-year old mud brick villages
  that seem to rise organically from the Earth itself. Meet the warm Berber
  villagers and learn about their ancient customs as you watch women hand spin
  wool from their sheep into intricate rugs and tapestries. Breathe in the fresh
  mountain air scented by aromatic wild herbs as you witness stunning vistas
  overlooking the valleys below.
</p>
<p>
  Wander the great imperial cities like Fez, with its nearly 1000-year history
  displayed in the world’s oldest and largest living medieval city.&nbsp; Marvel
  at the splendid doors that mark the entrances to the homes and businesses in
  the old Jewish Quarter. Let your senses guide you through the pungent smells
  emanating from the dye pits made from natural pigments and medicinal herbs
  that have persisted over centuries of artisan production.
</p>
<p>
  As the sun sets, make your way to the mighty Sahara, where I recommend
  spending the night at a traditional nomadic style luxury desert camp, sleeping
  under crystal clear starry skies on vibrant Berber rugs and feasting on
  delicious slow roasted meats and vegetables cooked in a sand oven. An early
  morning camel trek to catch the brilliant glow of sunrise over never-ending
  golden sand dunes will take your breath away.
</p>
<p>
  There is an enchantment to Morocco that casts a magical spell over its
  visitors. I hope you too will have a chance to experience its rich culture,
  endless visual delights and warm hospitality. Just be sure to allow yourself
  to wander and don’t be afraid to get a little lost – sometimes the best
  experiences can be unexpectedly found down the next alley! Let me know if you
  would like any other recommendations for your time exploring this incredible
  country. I would be happy to offer further insights from my travels.
